# SystemVerilog-Project-Simple-Microprocessor-Design-and-Verification
Simple five operations microprocessor design and verification project. The code is written in SystemVerilog for design files and test bench. Synopsys VCS tool is used for generating the verification coverage reports.

## Design Specifications
-	8-bit microprocessor.
-	Five operations: Two arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB), Two logic operations (AND, OR) and JUMP operation.
-	Outputs: 8-bit result, zero flag and overflow flag.
